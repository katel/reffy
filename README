==Reffy

A fork of Jay Godse's Punchy! app modified to work for library reference enquiries. Enquiries are now enquiries. Instead of: 
*action
#project
@client

Reffy uses: 
*action (should this be method)
#subject
@type (of enquiry)

==Welcome to Reffy!

Punchy is a super simple, straight forward rails 3.0 app that allows you to keep track of what you've been working on.

==How it works

The premise is simple: setting up projects and clients sucks.  No drop down menus, one button, nothing else.  You can begin logging your work within seconds.  To input a new time enquiry, simply type in something to the effect of "*programmed for @client_1 for 4 hours on #project_1"  Anything starting with a "*" is recorded as an action, "#" is recorded as a project and "@" is recorded as a client.

That's it!  It will keep track of all the minutes you work and let you know where all your time is going!

==Why?

I developed Punchy so I could log the time I spend on various projects the way I choose to - with minimal interference in my day.  I prefer to work without interference and then log my time after the fact.


==Deploying on Heroku
Punchy can be deployed on Heroku!  To do so, you just need to make sure you use the bamboo stack because Punchy uses Rails 3.0.  Run the following commands to get up and running in seconds:

heroku create your_subdomain --stack bamboo-ree-1.8.7
git push heroku master
heroku rake db:migrate

and you're done, except the time zone defaults to UTC. Read the next section to setup your own timezone.


==But the days are all messed up?

Enquiryy is currently set to UTC.  If you live elsewhere, you'll need to run: 

  rake time:zones:all 

in your local environment to get a legal list of values. Pick a relevant one and then run:

  heroku config:add MY_TIME_ZONE="Eastern Time (US & Canada)"
