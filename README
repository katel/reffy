==Reffy

Reffy is a fork of Punchy, repurposed to keep track of library enquiries. 

And, like with Punchy, the premise is simple: keeping a record of enquiries in the library sucks.  No drop down menus, one button, nothing else.  You can begin logging your enquiries seconds.  To input a new enquiry, simply type in something to the effect of "*email enquiry for @student for 4 hours on #topic"  Anything starting with a "*" is recorded as an action, "#" is recorded as a project and "@" is recorded as a client.

That's it!  Punchy will keep track of all the minutes you work and let you know where all your time is going!

A fork of Jay Godse's Punchy! app modified to work for library reference enquiries. Punches are now enquiries. Instead of: 
*action
#project
@client

Reffy uses: 
*enquiry type/method
#subject
@user

==Background

Punchy was developed by Ryan Quinn as a super simple, straight forward rails 3.0 app that allows you to keep track of what you've been working on. 


==Deploying on Heroku
Punchy can be deployed on Heroku!  To do so, you just need to make sure you use the bamboo stack because Punchy uses Rails 3.0.  Run the following commands to get up and running in seconds:

heroku create your_subdomain --stack bamboo-ree-1.8.7
git push heroku master
heroku rake db:migrate

and you're done, except the time zone defaults to UTC. Read the next section to setup your own timezone.


==But the days are all messed up?

Reffy is currently set to UTC.  If you live elsewhere, you'll need to run: 

  rake time:zones:all 

in your local environment to get a legal list of values. Pick a relevant one and then run:

  heroku config:add MY_TIME_ZONE="Eastern Time (US & Canada)"
