		<h2>Welcome to Reffy!</h2>
		<p>
			Reffy is a simple, easy to use webapp for tracking the time you spend working on subjects.  To get you started, here's a brief introduction to how it works!
		</p>
		<p>
			To enter a time enquiry, simply type it in the bar above.  Enquiries can reference <span class="important subject">#Subjects</span>, <span class="important type">*Types</span> or <span class="important patron">@Patrons</span>.
		</p>
		<img src="images/enquiry_screen.png" />
		<p>
			For example, let's say you designed a new flyer for Company A and it took you 3 hours.  You could write "*design #flyer for @company_a for 3 hours."  Doing this will allow you to track how much time you spent working on/for any type, subject or patron.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you have a few enquiries logged, you can click on any type/patron/subject to see how much time has been spent on it recently.  We'll be adding better data breakdowns as time goes on, but for the time being you can track your time investment for the day, week, month or year.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you have any issues, please let me know in the issue tracker on github.  Thanks for trying out enquiryy!
